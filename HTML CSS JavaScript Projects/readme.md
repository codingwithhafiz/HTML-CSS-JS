# HTML CSS JS GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This is a collection of Frontend web development projects that showcase my skills and experience in creating dynamic and visually appealing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Responsive: All projects have been designed with responsive layouts, ensuring they look great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- User-friendly: Each project has been created with the user in mind, providing clear navigation and intuitive interfaces.
- Fast and lightweight: The projects have been optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring fast load times and minimal resource usage.

## Repository Structure

Each project repository contains the following files and directories:

- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for running the project locally.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `css/`: A directory containing CSS files for styling the page.
- `js/`: A directory containing JavaScript files for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.
- `img/`: A directory containing images used in the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of my projects, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and seeing what I've been working on!
